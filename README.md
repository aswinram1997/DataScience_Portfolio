## 2. Work-related Projects

### 2.1 Direct Construction Cost Estimation with ML

<div style="text-align: justify">This pioneering project addresses the inefficiencies and errors in manual estimation methods for prefabricated residential construction costs. Introducing two robust ML models for predicting direct material, and labor costs, trained on a comprehensive job cost dataset with home design and project-related features, this project offers a transformative solution. These ML models offer remarkable accuracy, as evidenced by their impressive metrics: the model for predicting direct material costs achieves an R2 score of 0.96, while the model for estimating direct labor costs achieves an R2 score of 0.92.  Seamlessly integrated into a single innovative application, these ML models revolutionize cost estimation by enhancing accuracy, operational efficiency, and providing a competitive advantage over competitors relying on traditional cost estimation methods.
