<div style="text-align: justify">The release of Google's BERT is described as the beginning of a new era in NLP. In this notebook I'll use the HuggingFace's transformers library to fine-tune pretrained BERT model for a classification task. Then I will compare BERT's performance with a baseline model, in which I use a TF-IDF vectorizer and a Naive Bayes classifier. The transformers library helps us quickly and efficiently fine-tune the state-of-the-art BERT model and yield an accuracy rate 10% higher than the baseline model.</div>
